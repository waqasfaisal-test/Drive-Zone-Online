    <p>Sometimes the newest version of Drive Zone Online doesn’t run as expected. You might see crashes, slower performance, or features that stop working. This usually happens because the update still has bugs or your device isn’t fully compatible with the changes.<br>
    So you can still join in on action with the older version of the game. These older versions can run smoothly on devices that are incompatible with the newest version. By keeping the older versions intact you can continue, without needing to wait for the newest release.<br>
    Many gamers keep the older versions of the game as backup for such times. It simply makes sure that you don’t miss out on fun in case of any update. So you can enjoy gaming without any interruption until developers fix that issue.
